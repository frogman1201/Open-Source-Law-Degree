# The Open Source Law Degree

## Introduction and Thanks

The aim of this repository is to provide a collection of freely-available resources for individuals to learn about the law of England and Wales.

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by the [Open Source CS Degree](https://github.com/ForrestKnight/open-source-cs).

If you find any linked resources that are no longer available, please raise an issue.

## Challenges with the project

Studying law through freely-available resources offers two challenges: (1) access to key cases and (2) developing legal writing skills

## Overall Approach to the Open Source Law Degree

The first section I recommend to start with is the Legal Research area. If you are new to studying law, it will provide you with the necessary tools and assumptions needed to understand and engage with the material in other areas.

* [Legal Research (START HERE)](00%20-%20Legal%20Research/Section%20Overview.md)

Once you have finished that section, you are free to start looking at different subjects. Typically speaking, most universities start with either Torts, Contracts or Admin Law, as those subjects tend to be easier to dig into for someone new to studying law.

To provide some structure without being overly prescriptive, I have separated the subjects into 1st, 2nd and 3rd year subjects. I would recommend that you look to complete most of the 1st year subjects before moving onto the 2nd year subjects and so on, but you are free to do otherwise.

### 1st Year

* [Constitutional and Administrative Law](01%20-%20Constitutional%20Law/section-overview.md)

* [Criminal Law](04%20-%20Criminal%20Law/section-overview.md)

* [Contracts](03%20-%20Contract%20Law/section-overview.md)

* [Torts](03%20-%20Torts/section-overview.md)

## Other Disciplines

While the study of law is useful, we must remember that it does not exist in a vacuum. It is therefore useful to understand other disciplines to gain a wider appreciation of other fields and how they interact with the law.

For economics, the CORE project has produced a wonderful textbook that walks students through the fundamentals of economics and public policy. You can find the book [here](https://www.core-econ.org/espp/).
